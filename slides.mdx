# A build history

# About me

## no time for this.

---

In the beginning we had

# <img src="./images/react.png" width="250px" /> and <img src="./images/webpack.png" width="250px" />

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="webpack devDependencies"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/webpack-dev-deps.mdx")}
  lang="json"
  showNumbers={false}
  steps={[
    {},
    { lines: [4, 9, 14, 16, 18, 19]}
  ]}
/>

---

and we were happy

# 😃

---

<Appear>
  <p>But then</p>
  <p>the second project starts</p>
  <p>and the third</p>
  <p>and the n-th</p>
  <h2>and we need to keep everything updated</h2>
</Appear>

---

<Image src="./images/updates.png" />

<Notes>
  or no
</Notes>

export default Split

<img src="./images/webpack-migrate.png" width="250px" />

<Appear>
  <p>we end with a dependency madness</p>
  <p>plus the new version of `webpack`</p>
  <p>👈 incompatible with the old one</p>
  <p>multiplied by N projects</p>
</Appear>

---

# 😰

---

export default Split

# A new friend 😍
![](images/cra-mantain.png)

---

# but we use `sass`!?!

---

and CRA doesn't support `sass`

(yet)

---

`npm run eject`

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="CRA eject"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/cra-eject-package.mdx")}
  lang="json"
  showNumbers={true}
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [6, 53]}
  ]}
/>

---

and a brand new project using

---

<img src="images/vue.png" width="300px" />

# Vue.js

---

with his own ~~`react-scripts`~~ `@vue/cli`!
##### (that now is customizable)

---

## Another new best friend
![](images/parcel.png)

---

## supports

# <img src="./images/react.png" width="250px" /> and <img src="./images/vue.png" width="250px" />

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="parcel package"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/parcel-package.mdx")}
  lang="json"
  showNumbers={true}
/>

---

![](images/fine.jpg)

---

## and then the company sign a contract with a new client!
# 🤑🤑🤑🤑

---

# who asks us to have everything deployed in a custom environment

---

![](images/parcel-zero-config.png)

---

# let's fix it!
### parcel plugins
### almost no docs
## too hard

---

# Alternatives?

## `react-scripts-rewired`

<Appear>
  <p>customizable? ✅</p>
  <p>vue?</p>
</Appear>

---

# Alternatives?

## `neutrino`

<Appear>
  <p>customizable? ✅</p>
  <p>vue? ✅</p>
  <p>lint? ✅</p>
</Appear>

---

# Neutrino!
![](images/party-parrot.gif)

---

and everything is fine again
```json,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "neutrino start",
    "build": "neutrino build",
    "lint": "neutrino lint",
    "stylelint": "neutrino stylelint",

    "neutrino": "8.3.0",
    "node-sass": "4.9.4",
    "sass-loader": "7.1.0"
  }
```

---

export default Split

## until this:
<Appear>
  <img src="images/neutrino-build.png" width="100%" />
</Appear>

---

<img src="images/give-up.gif" height="100%" />

---

NO!

---

> "Let's create our own build scripts!"

---

## That supports:

- react
- vue
- less
- sass
- all the good parts of a `react-scripts`
- our crazy deploy!

---

# Good news!
